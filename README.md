# DocumentClassifierWithNN
Here we present the Neural Network implementation which is used in OCRBasedPredictionApp
# OCRDetection
Here you find the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) detection that was performed over thousands of scanned documents. The detected text will be used in the repository "DocumentClassifierWithNN" so a document classifier system using a neural network can be implemented.
